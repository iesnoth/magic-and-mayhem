# Magic and Mayhem: Adoption Agency

## Deployment

### AWS
We attempted to deploy on Elastic Beanstalk, and while it did send information to the backend at one point, it could not receive it to the front end.
This will be fixed in future.
*Current Deployment*: http://magicandmayhem-env.eba-2g3y7xfa.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

### Locally

Root:
- npm install

Backend:
- npm install
- nodemon index

Frontend:
- npm install
- npm start

NOTE: must have nodemon and sequelize to run

## Summary
Have you ever wanted a pet dragon?
Bad question, everyone has.
Have you ever wanted a one-of-a-kind dragon character that you have the rights to? Are you not an artist, or want to support artists?
If so, you'll love Magic and Mayhem, a site where artists can sell unique dragon designs for fellow creatives and collectors to use.
The heart and goal of this project is to lift up and protect artists, as well as have some fun.

## Description

### !!! DISCLAIMER !!!
Magic and Mayhem is not, and will not, be NFT-affliated.
Magi-May is based on the early 2000s idea of "adoptables".

### What are adoptables?
From the dawn of time, there has been art. From the dawn of the Internet, there has been new ways to buy and trade in art. One of those ways is the widely unknown but highly lucrative "adoptable".
Basically, an artist creates a character, usually some sort of animal, and sells the rights to that design. This is different from a print, as once the design is sold, the original artist will not sell the design again, or make art with the design. That privelege falls to the buyer.

Historically, the adoptables have been sold by the artist themselves through a social media like DeviantArt, where the trade was popularized. Each artist had their own rules for use of the characters, but no way of enforcing said rules.
Also, the success of the sales depended not on the quality of the art, but on the renown of the artist.

### Why do artists need Magic and Mayhem?
Our aim is to centralize the adoptables market.
This will have several benefits:
1. Artists of all backgrounds will get equal exposure to the client base.
2. Posting on the site will give artists free advertising for ventures outside the site.
3. Magic and Mayhem will provide "adoption papers" during a sale which will protect the artist's intellectual property and prevent scalping (buying pets then reselling them for a higher price).
4. All sales through Magi-May are final, and the artist keeps 75% of profit.


### How will Magic and Mayhem serve its customers?
1. Magi-May will screen all incoming artists and their entries to ensure uniqueness and authenticity.
    - Violators will be banned from selling on the site.
2. Buyers will gain access to a special board on the site which allows them to post how they are using the characters they bought.
    - This gives inspiration to other buyers, and is free advertising for those who use the designs in creative exploits.

### Features

- Encrypted passwords for log-ins
